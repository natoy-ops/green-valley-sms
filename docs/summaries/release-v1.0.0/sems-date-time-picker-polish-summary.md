# SEMS Date & Time Picker Polish Summary

## Key Updates

- **Date range picker safeguards**: Prevented selecting past dates and applied custom theming plus aligned navigation controls for create/update event dialogs.
- **Calendar UI refinements**: Replaced default DayPicker visuals with project theme colors and resolved button overflow issues.
- **Time picker redesign**: Added 12-hour display with AM/PM toggles, hide scrollbars, improved theme alignment, reduced interaction lag, and only close the picker when changing period.
- **User feedback**: Added Sonner success toasts after creating or updating SEMS events for immediate confirmation.

## Impact

These changes deliver a more professional SEMS scheduling experience by enforcing valid date ranges, matching the platform’s dark/light aesthetics, and smoothing the time selection workflow while providing clearer feedback after saves.
