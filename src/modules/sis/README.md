# SIS Module – Core Registry & Identity

Single source of truth for students and staff.

Expected subfolders:
- `domain/` – entities (Student, Staff, Guardian, etc.) and value objects
- `application/` – use-cases (createStudent, bulkImportStudents, etc.)
- `infrastructure/` – repositories and mappers (Supabase, cache, etc.)
- `ui/` – SIS-specific React components/hooks
