# Netlify Configuration for School Management System
# This file defines the build settings, environment variables, and deployment configurations
# for deploying the Next.js application to Netlify.

[build]
  # Specifies the command to build the Next.js application
  # Clean ALL cache directories (including Netlify's .netlify directory) 
  # to prevent false positive secret scanning of webpack cache
  command = "rm -rf .next/cache .netlify/.next/cache && npm run build"
  
  # Directory where the build output is stored
  # When using @netlify/plugin-nextjs, the plugin handles the publish directory
  # Set to .next for Next.js builds (plugin will manage the actual deployment)
  publish = ".next"
  
  # Node.js version requirement (must match package.json engines)
  NODE_VERSION = "18.17.0"
  
  # Ignore command allows Netlify to skip builds when only docs/non-code files change
  ignore = "git diff --quiet $CACHED_COMMIT_REF $COMMIT_REF -- . ':!docs/' ':!*.md' ':!summary/'"

# Build environment variables
[build.environment]
  # Next.js specific environment variables for optimal Netlify deployment
  NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED = "1"
  NPM_FLAGS = "--legacy-peer-deps"
  
  # Set NETLIFY flag to true (used in next.config.js to disable caching)
  # This prevents webpack cache from triggering false positive secret scanning
  NETLIFY = "true"

# Plugin configuration for Next.js on Netlify
# The @netlify/plugin-nextjs plugin provides Next.js optimizations
# This plugin automatically:
# - Handles Next.js API routes at /api/*
# - Manages Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG)
# - Optimizes build output for Netlify's CDN
# - Manages rewrites, redirects, and middleware

# ===================================
# SECRET SCANNING CONFIGURATION
# ===================================
# Netlify automatically scans builds for potential secrets.
# For Next.js apps, NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are INTENTIONALLY public
# and will appear in webpack cache - this is expected behavior.
# 
# SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
# 1. Disabled webpack filesystem caching in next.config.js when NETLIFY=true
# 2. Clean cache directories before build (rm -rf .next/cache .netlify/.next/cache)
# 3. Excluded cache directories in .netlifyignore (for deployment)
# 4. Documented that NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables are safe to expose
#
# Trade-off: Builds are slightly slower without cache (~30-60s longer)
# Benefit: Eliminates false positive secret scanning warnings
#
# If you still see warnings for NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL:
# - This is a FALSE POSITIVE (these vars are meant to be public)
# - The anon key is protected by Supabase Row Level Security (RLS)
# - Service role key is NEVER exposed (server-side only, no NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix)
# - Safe to acknowledge and proceed with deployment
